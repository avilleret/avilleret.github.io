## Welcome to avilleret's GitHub Pages

My name is Antoine Villeret and I make computer vision and realtime processing software with C/C++, OpenCV, openFraworks, python, puredata... Most of my work is open source and available under my github account.
I'm also involved in the [OSSIA](https://github.com/OSSIA) developpement team.

One day I'll write some lines about things I made.
